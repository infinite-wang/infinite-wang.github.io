</ul><h2> About </h2><ul>
  <p>I am currently serving as an Associate Professor in the <a href="https://math.dlut.edu.cn/English.htm"> School of Mathematical Sciences</a> 
    at <a href="https://en.dlut.edu.cn/"> Dalian University of Technology</a>. 
  Prior to this, I was a postdoctoral researcher at <a href="https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm"> Yau Mathematical Sciences Center</a>, <a href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/"> Tsinghua University</a>, 
    under the mentorship of Professor <a href="https://ubw-q.github.io"> Yu Qiu</a>. 
  I received my Ph.D. from <a href="https://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en"> Osaka University</a> in March 2022, where I studied under the supervision of Professor <a href="http://math.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/course/course_arikisusumu/"> Susumu Ariki</a>. 
  I completed my master's degree at <a href="https://english.sufe.edu.cn/main.htm"> Shanghai University of Finance and Economics</a> in January 2018, 
    under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://math.sufe.edu.cn/aa/c4/c2019a43716/page.htm"> Yunchuan Yin</a>.

</ul><h2>Research Interests</h2><ul>
  My research focuses on the representation theory of finite-dimensional algebras, particularly classical classes of algebras such as Hecke algebras, 
  $q$-Schur algebras and Temperleyâ€“Lieb algebras, which arise in contexts such as Lie theory and knot theory. 
  I am also interested in exploring the applications of $\tau$-tilting theory, silting theory, and cluster algebra theory to the representation theories of these algebras. 
  For example, I investigated the $\tau$-tilting finiteness of classical Schur algebras.
